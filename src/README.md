# Project Files Overview

This repository contains files for processing and analyzing hyperspectral data in the wavelet domain. Below is a brief description of each file:

## Jupyter Notebooks

### 1. **Conversion to the wavelet domain (1D) - Abundancies and Endmembers.ipynb**
   - Converts hyperspectral data (abundances and endmembers) to the 1D wavelet domain for preprocessing and analysis.
   - Focuses on feature extraction and dimensionality reduction using wavelet transformations.

### 2. **GPU based HSU for Wavelets-Copy1.ipynb**
   - Implements GPU-based acceleration for Hyperspectral Unmixing (HSU) in the wavelet domain.
   - Enhances computational efficiency for large datasets using parallel processing.

### 3. **Transformed data 3L Spherical Abundance.ipynb**
   - Applies a 3-layer transformation to hyperspectral data with spherical abundance constraints.
   - Aims to optimize unmixing results while preserving physical constraints.

### 4. **Visualization of Activation Function.ipynb**
   - Visualizes the custom wavelet-based activation function used in the neural network model.
   - Includes plots and comparisons to standard activation functions.

### 5. **Wavelet-urban-Wavelet-Activated.ipynb**
   - Processes urban hyperspectral data with a wavelet-activated neural network.
   - Demonstrates the application of wavelet-based transformations in a real-world scenario.

### 6. **Wavelet_Activation_Wavelet_data.ipynb**
   - Integrates wavelet-activated layers with transformed hyperspectral data for analysis.
   - Explores the interplay between wavelet domain transformations and neural network activations.

### 7. **urban abundances.ipynb**
   - Focuses on extracting and analyzing abundance maps from urban hyperspectral datasets.
   - Includes visualizations and evaluation metrics for the extracted abundances.
